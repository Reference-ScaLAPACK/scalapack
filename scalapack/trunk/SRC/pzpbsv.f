*                      A(1:N, JA:JA+N-1) * X = B(IB:IB+N-1, 1:NRHS)
*
*  where A(1:N, JA:JA+N-1) is an N-by-N complex
*  banded symmetric positive definite distributed

*
*
*  Restrictions
*  ============
*
*  The following are restrictions on the input parameters. Some of these
*    are temporary and will be removed in future releases, while others
*    may reflect fundamental technical limitations.
*
*    Non-cyclic restriction: VERY IMPORTANT!
*      P*NB>= mod(JA-1,NB)+N.
*      The mapping for matrices must be blocked, reflecting the nature
*      of the divide and conquer algorithm as a task-parallel algorithm.
*      This formula in words is: no processor may have more than one
*      chunk of the matrix.
*
*    Blocksize cannot be too small:
*      If the matrix spans more than one processor, the following
*      restriction on NB, the size of each block on each processor,
*      must hold:
*      NB >= 2*BW
*      The bulk of parallel computation is done on the matrix of size
*      O(NB) on each processor. If this is too small, divide and conquer
*      is a poor choice of algorithm.
*
*    Submatrix reference:
*      JA = IB
*      Alignment restriction that prevents unnecessary communication.

*  Notes
*  =====
*
*  If the factorization routine and the solve routine are to be called
*    separately (to solve various sets of righthand sides using the same
*    coefficient matrix), the auxiliary space AF *must not be altered*
*    between calls to the factorization routine and the solve routine.
*
*  The best algorithm for solving banded and tridiagonal linear systems
*    depends on a variety of parameters, especially the bandwidth.
*    Currently, only algorithms designed for the case N/P >> bw are
*    implemented. These go by many names, including Divide and Conquer,
*    Partitioning, domain decomposition-type, etc.
*
*  Algorithm description: Divide and Conquer
*
*    The Divide and Conqer algorithm assumes the matrix is narrowly
*      banded compared with the number of equations. In this situation,
*      it is best to distribute the input matrix A one-dimensionally,
*      with columns atomic and rows divided amongst the processes.
*      The basic algorithm divides the banded matrix up into
*      P pieces with one stored on each processor,
*      and then proceeds in 2 phases for the factorization or 3 for the
*      solution of a linear system.
*      1) Local Phase:
*         The individual pieces are factored independently and in
*         parallel. These factors are applied to the matrix creating
*         fillin, which is stored in a non-inspectable way in auxiliary
*         space AF. Mathematically, this is equivalent to reordering
*         the matrix A as P A P^T and then factoring the principal
*         leading submatrix of size equal to the sum of the sizes of
*         the matrices factored on each processor. The factors of
*         these submatrices overwrite the corresponding parts of A
*         in memory.
*      2) Reduced System Phase:
*         A small (BW* (P-1)) system is formed representing
*         interaction of the larger blocks, and is stored (as are its
*         factors) in the space AF. A parallel Block Cyclic Reduction
*         algorithm is used. For a linear system, a parallel front solve
*         followed by an analagous backsolve, both using the structure
*         of the factored matrix, are performed.
*      3) Backsubsitution Phase:
*         For a linear system, a local backsubstitution is performed on
*         each processor in parallel.
*
*
*  Descriptors
*  ===========
*
*  Descriptors now have *types* and differ from ScaLAPACK 1.0.
*
*  Note: banded codes can use either the old two dimensional
*    or new one-dimensional descriptors, though the processor grid in
*    both cases *must be one-dimensional*. We describe both types below.
*
*  Each global data object is described by an associated description
*  vector.  This vector stores the information required to establish
*  the mapping between an object element and its corresponding process
*  and memory location.
*
*  Let A be a generic term for any 2D block cyclicly distributed array.
*  Such a global array has an associated description vector DESCA.
*  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as
*  "of the global array".
*
*  NOTATION        STORED IN      EXPLANATION
*  --------------- -------------- --------------------------------------
*  DTYPE_A(global) DESCA( DTYPE_ )The descriptor type.  In this case,
*                                 DTYPE_A = 1.
*  CTXT_A (global) DESCA( CTXT_ ) The BLACS context handle, indicating
*                                 the BLACS process grid A is distribu-
*                                 ted over. The context itself is glo-
*                                 bal, but the handle (the integer
*                                 value) may vary.
*  M_A    (global) DESCA( M_ )    The number of rows in the global
*                                 array A.
*  N_A    (global) DESCA( N_ )    The number of columns in the global
*                                 array A.
*  MB_A   (global) DESCA( MB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
*                                 the rows of the array.
*  NB_A   (global) DESCA( NB_ )   The blocking factor used to distribute
*                                 the columns of the array.
*  RSRC_A (global) DESCA( RSRC_ ) The process row over which the first
*                                 row of the array A is distributed.
*  CSRC_A (global) DESCA( CSRC_ ) The process column over which the
*                                 first column of the array A is
*                                 distributed.
*  LLD_A  (local)  DESCA( LLD_ )  The leading dimension of the local
*                                 array.  LLD_A >= MAX(1,LOCr(M_A)).
*
*  Let K be the number of rows or columns of a distributed matrix,
*  and assume that its process grid has dimension p x q.
*  LOCr( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a process
*  would receive if K were distributed over the p processes of its
*  process column.
*  Similarly, LOCc( K ) denotes the number of elements of K that a
*  process would receive if K were distributed over the q processes of
*  its process row.
*  The values of LOCr() and LOCc() may be determined via a call to the
*  ScaLAPACK tool function, NUMROC:
*          LOCr( M ) = NUMROC( M, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW ),
*          LOCc( N ) = NUMROC( N, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL ).
*  An upper bound for these quantities may be computed by:
*          LOCr( M ) <= ceil( ceil(M/MB_A)/NPROW )*MB_A
*          LOCc( N ) <= ceil( ceil(N/NB_A)/NPCOL )*NB_A
*
*
*  One-dimensional descriptors:
*
*  One-dimensional descriptors are a new addition to ScaLAPACK since
*    version 1.0. They simplify and shorten the descriptor for 1D
*    arrays.
*
*  Since ScaLAPACK supports two-dimensional arrays as the fundamental
*    object, we allow 1D arrays to be distributed either over the
*    first dimension of the array (as if the grid were P-by-1) or the
*    2nd dimension (as if the grid were 1-by-P). This choice is
*    indicated by the descriptor type (501 or 502)
*    as described below.
*
*    IMPORTANT NOTE: the actual BLACS grid represented by the
*    CTXT entry in the descriptor may be *either*  P-by-1 or 1-by-P
*    irrespective of which one-dimensional descriptor type
*    (501 or 502) is input.
*    This routine will interpret the grid properly either way.
*    ScaLAPACK routines *do not support intercontext operations* so that
*    the grid passed to a single ScaLAPACK routine *must be the same*
*    for all array descriptors passed to that routine.
*
*    NOTE: In all cases where 1D descriptors are used, 2D descriptors
*    may also be used, since a one-dimensional array is a special case
*    of a two-dimensional array with one dimension of size unity.
*    The two-dimensional array used in this case *must* be of the
*    proper orientation:
*      If the appropriate one-dimensional descriptor is DTYPEA=501
*      (1 by P type), then the two dimensional descriptor must
*      have a CTXT value that refers to a 1 by P BLACS grid;
*      If the appropriate one-dimensional descriptor is DTYPEA=502
*      (P by 1 type), then the two dimensional descriptor must
*      have a CTXT value that refers to a P by 1 BLACS grid.
*
*
*  Summary of allowed descriptors, types, and BLACS grids:
*  DTYPE           501         502         1         1
*  BLACS grid      1xP or Px1  1xP or Px1  1xP       Px1
*  -----------------------------------------------------
*  A               OK          NO          OK        NO
*  B               NO          OK          NO        OK
*
*  Note that a consequence of this chart is that it is not possible
*    for *both* DTYPE_A and DTYPE_B to be 2D_type(1), as these lead
*    to opposite requirements for the orientation of the BLACS grid,
*    and as noted before, the *same* BLACS context must be used in
*    all descriptors in a single ScaLAPACK subroutine call.
*
*  Let A be a generic term for any 1D block cyclicly distributed array.
*  Such a global array has an associated description vector DESCA.
*  In the following comments, the character _ should be read as
*  "of the global array".
