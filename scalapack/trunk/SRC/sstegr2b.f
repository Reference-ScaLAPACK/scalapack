*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  SSTEGR2B should only be called after a call to SSTEGR2A.
*  From eigenvalues and initial representations computed by SSTEGR2A,
*  SSTEGR2B computes the selected eigenvalues and eigenvectors
*  of the real symmetric tridiagonal matrix in parallel 
*  on multiple processors. It is potentially invoked multiple times
*  on a given processor because the locally relevant representation tree 
*  might depend on spectral information that is "owned" by other processors
*  and might need to be communicated. 
* 
*  Please note:
*  1. The calling sequence has two additional INTEGER parameters, 
*     DOL and DOU, that should satisfy M>=DOU>=DOL>=1. 
*     These parameters are only relevant for the case JOBZ = 'V'.
*     SSTEGR2B  ONLY computes the eigenVECTORS 
*     corresponding to eigenvalues DOL through DOU in W. (That is,
*     instead of computing the eigenvectors belonging to W(1) 
*     through W(M), only the eigenvectors belonging to eigenvalues
*     W(DOL) through W(DOU) are computed. In this case, only the
*     eigenvalues DOL:DOU are guaranteed to be accurately refined
*     to all figures by Rayleigh-Quotient iteration.
*
*  2. The additional arguments VSTART, FINISH, NDEPTH, PARITY, ZOFFSET 
*     are included as a thread-safe implementation equivalent to SAVE variables.
*     These variables store details about the local representation tree which is
*     computed layerwise. For scalability reasons, eigenvalues belonging to the 
*     locally relevant representation tree might be computed on other processors.
*     These need to be communicated before the inspection of the RRRs can proceed
*     on any given layer.           
*     Note that only when the variable FINISH is true, the computation has ended
*     All eigenpairs between DOL and DOU have been computed. M is set = DOU - DOL + 1.
*
*  3. SSTEGR2B needs more workspace in Z than the sequential SSTEGR. 
*     It is used to store the conformal embedding of the local representation tree.  
*  
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  JOBZ    (input) CHARACTER*1
*          = 'N':  Compute eigenvalues only;
*          = 'V':  Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
*
*  N       (input) INTEGER
*          The order of the matrix.  N >= 0.
*
*  D       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the N diagonal elements of the tridiagonal matrix
*          T. On exit, D is overwritten.
*
*  E       (input/output) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          On entry, the (N-1) subdiagonal elements of the tridiagonal
*          matrix T in elements 1 to N-1 of E. E(N) need not be set on
*          input, but is used internally as workspace.
*          On exit, E is overwritten.
*
*  M       (input) INTEGER
*          The total number of eigenvalues found
*          in SSTEGR2A.  0 <= M <= N.
*
*  W       (input) REAL array, dimension (N)
*          The first M elements contain approximations to the selected 
*          eigenvalues in ascending order. Note that only the eigenvalues from
*          the locally relevant part of the representation tree, that is
*          all the clusters that include eigenvalues from DOL:DOU, are reliable 
*          on this processor. (It does not need to know about any others anyway.)
*
*  Z       (output) REAL array, dimension (LDZ, max(1,M) )
*          If JOBZ = 'V', and if INFO = 0, then 
*          a subset of the first M columns of Z
*          contain the orthonormal eigenvectors of the matrix T
*          corresponding to the selected eigenvalues, with the i-th
*          column of Z holding the eigenvector associated with W(i).
*          See DOL, DOU for more information.
*
*  LDZ     (input) INTEGER
*          The leading dimension of the array Z.  LDZ >= 1, and if
*          JOBZ = 'V', then LDZ >= max(1,N).
*
*  NZC     (input) INTEGER
*          The number of eigenvectors to be held in the array Z.  
*
*  ISUPPZ  (output) INTEGER ARRAY, dimension ( 2*max(1,M) )
*          The support of the eigenvectors in Z, i.e., the indices
*          indicating the nonzero elements in Z. The i-th computed eigenvector
*          is nonzero only in elements ISUPPZ( 2*i-1 ) through
*          ISUPPZ( 2*i ). This is relevant in the case when the matrix 
*          is split. ISUPPZ is only set if N>2.
*
*  WORK    (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension (LWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, WORK(1) returns the optimal
*          (and minimal) LWORK.
*
*  LWORK   (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array WORK. LWORK >= max(1,18*N)
*          if JOBZ = 'V', and LWORK >= max(1,12*N) if JOBZ = 'N'.
*          If LWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the routine
*          only calculates the optimal size of the WORK array, returns
*          this value as the first entry of the WORK array, and no error
*          message related to LWORK is issued.
*
*  IWORK   (workspace/output) INTEGER array, dimension (LIWORK)
*          On exit, if INFO = 0, IWORK(1) returns the optimal LIWORK.
*
*  LIWORK  (input) INTEGER
*          The dimension of the array IWORK.  LIWORK >= max(1,10*N)
*          if the eigenvectors are desired, and LIWORK >= max(1,8*N)
*          if only the eigenvalues are to be computed.
*          If LIWORK = -1, then a workspace query is assumed; the
*          routine only calculates the optimal size of the IWORK array,
*          returns this value as the first entry of the IWORK array, and
*          no error message related to LIWORK is issued.
*
*  DOL     (input) INTEGER
*  DOU     (input) INTEGER
*          From the eigenvalues W(1:M), only eigenvectors 
*          Z(:,DOL) to Z(:,DOU) are computed.
*          If DOL > 1, then Z(:,DOL-1-ZOFFSET) is used and overwritten.
*          If DOU < M, then Z(:,DOU+1-ZOFFSET) is used and overwritten.
*
*  NEEDIL  (input/output) INTEGER 
*  NEEDIU  (input/output) INTEGER
*          Describes which are the left and right outermost eigenvalues 
*          still to be computed. Initially computed by SLARRE2A,
*          modified in the course of the algorithm.
*
*  INDWLC  (output) REAL
*          Pointer into the workspace, location where the local
*          eigenvalue representations are stored. ("Local eigenvalues"
*          are those relative to the individual shifts of the RRRs.)
*
*  PIVMIN  (input) REAL
*          The minimum pivot in the sturm sequence for T.
*
*  SCALE   (input) REAL 
*          The scaling factor for T. Used for unscaling the eigenvalues
*          at the very end of the algorithm.
*
*  WL      (input) REAL
*  WU      (input) REAL
*          The interval (WL, WU] contains all the wanted eigenvalues.         
*
*  VSTART  (input/output) LOGICAL 
*          .TRUE. on initialization, set to .FALSE. afterwards.
*
*  FINISH  (input/output) LOGICAL
*          indicates whether all eigenpairs have been computed
*
*  MAXCLS  (input/output) INTEGER
*          The largest cluster worked on by this processor in the
*          representation tree.
*
*  NDEPTH  (input/output) INTEGER
*          The current depth of the representation tree. Set to
*          zero on initial pass, changed when the deeper levels of
*          the representation tree are generated. 
*
*  PARITY  (input/output) INTEGER
*          An internal parameter needed for the storage of the
*          clusters on the current level of the representation tree.
*
*  ZOFFSET (input) INTEGER
*          Offset for storing the eigenpairs when Z is distributed
*          in 1D-cyclic fashion
*
*  INFO    (output) INTEGER
*          On exit, INFO
*          = 0:  successful exit
*          other:if INFO = -i, the i-th argument had an illegal value
*                if INFO = 20X, internal error in SLARRV2.
*                Here, the digit X = ABS( IINFO ) < 10, where IINFO is 
*                the nonzero error code returned by SLARRV2.
