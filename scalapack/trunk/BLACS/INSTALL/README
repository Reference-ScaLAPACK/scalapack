These routines help to configure the BLACS and its tester during installation.
See the paper "Installing and testing the BLACS" for details.


xintface will tell you the correct setting for Bmake.inc's INTFACE macro.

xsize prints out the correct sizes for various data types, which are hardwired
in btprim_PVM.c ibtsizeof.

============================ MPI SPECIFIC ROUTINES ============================
xsyserrors indicates the correct setting for Bmake.inc's SYSERRORS macro.

xcmpi_sane will give you a sanity test to see if the most basic MPI program
will run on your system using the C interface to MPI.

xfmpi_sane will give you a sanity test to see if the most basic MPI program
will run on your system using the Fortran77 interface to MPI.

              *****  FINDING THE CORRECT TRANSCOMM SETTING  *****
The remaining routines exist in order to allow the user to find the correct
setting for Bmake.inc's TRANSCOMM macro.  THESE ROUTINES USE HEURISTICS, AND
THUS MAY BE INCORRECT.

First make and run xtc_CsameF77.  If this reports back not to set TRANSCOMM
to -DCSameF77 or does not complete, make and run xtc_UseMpich.  If this fails to
compile or does not tell you what to set TRANSCOMM to, you must leave TRANSCOMM
blank.
