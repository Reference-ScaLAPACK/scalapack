(1)  To compile, just type "make".  You must first edit and correct the
     file BLACS/Bmake.inc.  Sample Bmake.inc's can be found in the
     BLACS/BMAKES directories.  See the paper "Installing and testing the BLACS"
     for details.

(2)  Type "make clean" to get rid of old .o files.

(3)  The file blacstest.f is extremely large (roughly 20,000 lines),
     and this may be too large to compile on some systems.  If you have this
     problem, a slight modification to the BLACS/TESTING Makefile should allow
     you to split blacstest.f into smaller files.
