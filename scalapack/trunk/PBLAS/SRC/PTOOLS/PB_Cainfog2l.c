*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  PB_Cainfog2l computes the  starting  local row and column indexes II,
*  JJ  corresponding to  the  submatrix  starting  globally at the entry
*  pointed by I,  J. This routine returns the coordinates in the grid of
*  the  process owning  the  matrix entry of global indexes I, J, namely
*  PROW  and  PCOL. In addition, this routine computes the quantities MP
*  and  NQ,  which are respectively the local number of rows and columns
*  owned by the process of coordinate  MYROW, MYCOL corresponding to the
*  global submatrix A(I:I+M-1,J:J+N-1).  Finally, the size  of the first
*  partial block and the relative process coordinates  are also returned
*  respectively in IMB, INB and RPROW, RPCOL.
*
*  Notes
*  =====
*
*  A description  vector  is associated with each 2D block-cyclicly dis-
*  tributed matrix.  This  vector  stores  the  information  required to
*  establish the  mapping  between a  matrix entry and its corresponding
*  process and memory location.
*
*  In  the  following  comments,   the character _  should  be  read  as
*  "of  the  distributed  matrix".  Let  A  be a generic term for any 2D
*  block cyclicly distributed matrix.  Its description vector is DESC_A:
*
*  NOTATION         STORED IN       EXPLANATION
*  ---------------- --------------- ------------------------------------

*  CTXT_A  (global) DESCA[ CTXT_  ] The BLACS context handle, indicating

*                                   A  is  distributed over. The context
*                                   itself  is  global,  but  the handle
*                                   (the integer value) may vary.
*  M_A     (global) DESCA[ M_     ] The  number of rows in the distribu-

*  INB_A   (global) DESCA[ INB_   ] The  number  of columns of the upper
*                                   left   block   of   the  matrix   A,
*                                   INB_A > 0.

*                                   bute the last  M_A-IMB_A  rows of A,

*  NB_A    (global) DESCA[ NB_    ] The blocking factor used to  distri-
*                                   bute the last  N_A-INB_A  columns of
*                                   A, NB_A > 0.
*  RSRC_A  (global) DESCA[ RSRC_  ] The process row over which the first
*                                   row of the matrix  A is distributed,
*                                   NPROW > RSRC_A >= 0.
*  CSRC_A  (global) DESCA[ CSRC_  ] The  process column  over  which the
*                                   first column of  A  is  distributed.
*                                   NPCOL > CSRC_A >= 0.
*  LLD_A   (local)  DESCA[ LLD_   ] The  leading dimension  of the local
*                                   array  storing  the  local blocks of
*                                   the distributed matrix A,
*                                   IF( Lc( 1, N_A ) > 0 )
*                                      LLD_A >= MAX( 1, Lr( 1, M_A ) )
*                                   ELSE
*                                      LLD_A >= 1.
*
*  Let K be the number of  rows of a matrix A starting at the global in-
*  dex IA,i.e, A( IA:IA+K-1, : ). Lr( IA, K ) denotes the number of rows
*  that the process of row coordinate MYROW ( 0 <= MYROW < NPROW ) would
*  receive if these K rows were distributed over NPROW processes.  If  K
*  is the number of columns of a matrix  A  starting at the global index
*  JA, i.e, A( :, JA:JA+K-1, : ), Lc( JA, K ) denotes the number  of co-
*  lumns that the process MYCOL ( 0 <= MYCOL < NPCOL ) would  receive if
*  these K columns were distributed over NPCOL processes.
*
*  The values of Lr() and Lc() may be determined via a call to the func-
*  tion PB_Cnumroc:
*  Lr( IA, K ) = PB_Cnumroc( K, IA, IMB_A, MB_A, MYROW, RSRC_A, NPROW )
*  Lc( JA, K ) = PB_Cnumroc( K, JA, INB_A, NB_A, MYCOL, CSRC_A, NPCOL )
