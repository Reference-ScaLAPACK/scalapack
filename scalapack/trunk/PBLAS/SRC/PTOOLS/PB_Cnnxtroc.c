/*
*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  PB_Cnnxtroc computes  the number of next rows or columns of a subma-
*  trix that are possessed by processes closer to  SRCPROC1  than  PROC
*  where  SRCPROC1 is the process owning the row or column globally in-
*  dexed by I. The submatrix is defined by giving out N rows or columns
*  starting  from  global index I.  Therefore, if SRCPROC=0 and PROC=1,
*  then PB_Cnnxtroc returns the number of matrix rows or columns  owned
*  by processes 2, 3 ... NPROCS-1.
*
*  In fact, if the same exact parameters N,  I,  INB,  NB,  SRCPROC and
*  NPROCS are passed to PB_Cnpreroc, PB_Cnumroc and PB_Cnnxtroc  produ-
*  cing respectively npre, np and nnxt,  then  npre + np + nnxt = N  in
*  every process PROC.
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  N       (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry, N  specifies the number of rows/columns being dealt
*          out. N must be at least zero.
*
*  I       (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry, I  specifies the global index of the matrix  entry.
*          I must be at least zero.
*
*  INB     (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  INB  specifies  the size of the first block of the
*          global matrix distribution. INB must be at least one.
*
*  NB      (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry, NB specifies the size of the blocks used to  parti-
*          tion the matrix. NB must be at least one.
*
*  PROC    (local input) INTEGER
*          On entry, PROC specifies  the coordinate of the process whose
*          local portion is determined.  PROC must be at least zero  and
*          strictly less than NPROCS.
*
*  SRCPROC (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  SRCPROC  specifies  the coordinate of the  process
*          that possesses the  first row or column  of the matrix.  When
*          SRCPROC = -1, the data  is not  distributed  but  replicated,
*          otherwise  SRCPROC  must be at least zero and  strictly  less
*          than NPROCS.
*
*  NPROCS  (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  NPROCS  specifies the total number of process rows
*          or columns over which the matrix is distributed.  NPROCS must
*          be at least one.

*  are only two possible cases:
*
*    1) When mydist = nblocks - ilocblk * NPROCS = 0, that is NPROCS divides
*       the global number of full blocks, then the source process SRCPROC owns
*       one more block than the other processes; Thus, N can be rewritten as
*       N  = INB + (nblocks-1) * NB + LNB with LNB >= 0 size of the last block.
*       Similarly, the local value Np corresponding to the local number of rows
*       and columns owned by the source process is INB + (ilocblk-1)*NB + LNB,
*       that is N + ( ilocblk-1 - (nblocks-1) )*NB. Therefore, there must be
*       ( nblocks - ilocblk ) * NB rows or columns following me. Note that this
*       case cannot happen when ilocblk is zero, since nblocks is at least one.
*
*    2) mydist = 0 < nblocks - ilocblk * NPROCS, the source process only owns
*       full blocks, and therefore locally INB + ilocblk * NB rows or columns.
*       Thus, N - INB - ilocblk * NB rows or columns follow me. Note that when
*       ilocblk is zero, this becomes simply N - INB.
