*  Purpose
*  =======
*
*  PB_CVMinit  initializes a virtual matrix with the information of an m
*  by  n  local  array  owned  by  the  process  of relative coordinates
*  ( MRROW, MRCOL ).
*
*  Arguments
*  =========
*
*  VM      (local output) pointer to a PB_VM_T structure
*          On entry,  VM  is  a pointer to a structure of type  PB_VM_T.
*          On exit,  VM  points  to the initialized structure containing
*          the virtual matrix information (see pblas.h).
*
*  OFFD    (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  OFFD  specifies the off-diagonal of the underlying
*          matrix of interest as follows:
*             OFFD = 0 specifies the main diagonal,
*             OFFD > 0 specifies lower subdiagonals, and
*             OFFD < 0 specifies upper superdiagonals.
*
*  M       (local input) INTEGER
*          On entry, M  specifies the local number of rows of the under-
*          lying matrix  owned  by the  process  of relative coordinates
*          ( MRROW, MRCOL ). M must be at least zero.
*
*  N       (local input) INTEGER
*          On entry, N  specifies the local number of columns of the un-
*          derlying matrix  owned by the process of relative coordinates
*          ( MRROW, MRCOL ). N must be at least zero.
*
*  IMB1    (global input) INTEGER
*          On input, IMB1 specifies  the global true size of  the  first
*          block of rows of the underlying global submatrix.  IMB1  must
*          be at least MIN( 1, M ).
*
*  INB1    (global input) INTEGER
*          On input, INB1 specifies  the global true size of  the  first
*          block  of  columns  of  the underlying global submatrix. INB1
*          must be at least MIN( 1, N ).
*
*  MB      (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry, MB  specifies the blocking factor used to partition
*          the rows of the matrix.  MB  must be at least one.
*
*  NB      (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry, NB  specifies the blocking factor used to partition
*          the the columns of the matrix.  NB  must be at least one.
*
*  MRROW   (local input) INTEGER
*          On entry, MRROW specifies the  relative row coordinate of the
*          process that possesses these M rows. MRROW must be least zero
*          and strictly less than NPROW.
*
*  MRCOL   (local input) INTEGER
*          On entry, MRCOL specifies  the  relative column coordinate of
*          the process that possesses these N  columns.  MRCOL  must  be
*          least zero and strictly less than NPCOL.
*
*  NPROW   (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  NPROW  specifies the total number of process rows
*          over which the matrix is distributed. NPROW must be at least
*          one.
*
*  NPCOL   (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  NPCOL  specifies the total number of process col-
*          umns over which the matrix is distributed.  NPCOL must be at
*          least one.
*
*  LCMB    (global input) INTEGER
*          On entry,  LCMB  specifies  the  least  common  multiple  of
*          NPROW * MB and NPCOL * NB.
