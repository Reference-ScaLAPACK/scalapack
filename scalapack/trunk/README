ScaLAPACK, or Scalable LAPACK, is a library of high performance linear
algebra routines for distributed memory message-passing MIMD computers
and networks of workstations supporting MPI and/or PVM.

The complete ScaLAPACK package is freely available on netlib and
can be obtained via the World Wide Web or anonymous ftp.

    http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/

ScaLAPACK, version 1.8, includes routines for the solution of dense,
band, and tridiagonal linear systems of equations, condition estimation and
iterative refinement, for LU and Cholesky factorization, matrix inversion,
full-rank linear least squares problems, orthogonal and generalized orthogonal
factorizations, orthogonal transformation routines, reductions to upper
Hessenberg, bidiagonal and tridiagonal form, reduction of a symmetric-definite/
Hermitian-definite generalized eigenproblem to standard form, the
symmetric/Hermitian, divide-and-conquer symmetric/Hermitian, generalized
symmetric/Hermitian and the nonsymmetric eigenproblem, and the singular value
decomposition.  With the exception of the singular value decomposition,
all routines are available in four types: single precision real, double
precision real, single precision complex, and double precision complex.

Unless otherwise noted, the current scalapack.tgz on netlib contains
all available updates.

Errata for ScaLAPACK (source code and documentation) can be found at:
  http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/errata.html

ScaLAPACK example programs can be found at:
  http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/examples/
Since ScaLAPACK 1.8, a basic example is include in the EXAMPLE directory.
 
Prototype versions of ScaLAPACK routines using packed storage are
now available in the scalapack/prototype directory on netlib:
   http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/prototype/packed.tgz
 
It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the ScaLAPACK
Users' Guide published by SIAM.  This Users' Guide gives a detailed
description of the philosophy behind ScaLAPACK as well as an explanation
of its usage.  Each Users' Guide includes a CD-ROM containing the HTML
version of the ScaLAPACK Users' Guide, the source code for the package,
testing and timing programs, prebuilt versions of the library for a number
of computers, example programs, and a full set of LAPACK Working Notes.
The ScaLAPACK Users' Guide can be purchased from:
SIAM; 3600 University City Science Center; Philadelphia, PA 19104-2688;
215-382-9800, FAX 215-386-7999.  It will also be available from
booksellers.

To order by email, send email to service@siam.org.  The book is also
available via SIAM's World Wide Web URL at http://www.siam.org.  The
ISBN number is 0-89871-397-8, and SIAM order code is SE04.  The list
price for SIAM members is $39.60; the cost for nonmembers is $49.50.

Prebuilt ScaLAPACK libraries are available for a variety of
architectures.

A number of technical reports were written during the development of
ScaLAPACK and published as LAPACK Working Notes by the University
of Tennessee.  These working notes are available in postscript and
pdf format.

NOTE:  It is assumed that the BLAS, BLACSi and LAPACK libraries (and possibly
       MPI or PVM) are available on your machine.  These libraries
       are NOT included with this distribution.  They can be obtained
       from the respective blas, blacs, mpi, or pvm directory on netlib.
       http://www.netlib.org/blas/
       http://www.netlib.org/lapack/

       http://www.open-mpi.org/
       http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/

All ScaLAPACK routines -- driver, computational, and auxiliary -- can be
found in the SRC/ directory.  Testing routines and input files can be found
in the TESTING/ directory.  All machine-specific parameters and the locations
of BLAS, BLACSi and LAPACK libraries are specified in the SCALAPACK/SLmake.inc file.
This include file is then referenced in all subdirectory Makefiles.  Once 
the include file has been modified, the entire installation process (including
the building of testing executables) can be performed by typing ``make''
in the top-level ScaLAPACK directory.  For detailed information on the
installation and testing process, please refer to the "Installation Guide
for ScaLAPACK" (scalapack_install.ps) in the INSTALL/ directory, or the
scalapack directory on netlib.
